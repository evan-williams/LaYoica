        <p>
            We arrived here in 1976, with a newly born baby and dreams of bringing up our family here.  
            Eduardo had just graduated as a Forest Engineer in Buenos Aires, and Jean had left her native Scotland behind to build a new life 
            together in El Bolson.La Yoica has been our home for over 40 years,we brought up our 4 girls here, and it has come a very long way from the wild thorn covered land we initially started with.
        </p>
        <p>
	        We have always maintained the focus of protecting the environment which we feel extremely lucky to live in, both for our family and to offer our visitors a truly unique and unforgettable experience. 
	        All the trees we have planted, the native woods we have protected, turning the farm into a Nature Reserve, and every single thing we do comes from a true love for nature and it's magic. 
	        Let us share it with you.
